# Learning in Public

Why sharing half-formed ideas is better than waiting for perfection.

## The Garden Metaphor

Digital gardens are about **tending to ideas over time** rather than publishing perfect, polished content. They embrace the concept of learning in public — sharing thoughts as they develop, allowing others to see your thinking process.

Traditional blogs are like streams of consciousness, moving forward chronologically. Digital gardens are more like topographies — ideas planted in one area can grow and connect to ideas in other areas.

## Why Share Half-Formed Ideas?

There's something liberating about sharing ideas before they're "ready." It removes the pressure of perfection and embraces the messy reality of how we actually learn and think.

- **Feedback loops:** Others can contribute to your thinking early on
- **Accountability:** Public commitment helps you follow through
- **Serendipity:** You never know who might find your ideas useful
- **Documentation:** Your future self will thank you

The same applies to ideas. The best time to share them might have been earlier, but the second best time is right now.
