# TypeScript Tips & Tricks

A collection of useful TypeScript patterns I keep coming back to.

## Type Inference

Let TypeScript do the work for you. Instead of explicitly typing everything, leverage inference:

```typescript
// Instead of this
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3]

// Just do this
const numbers = [1, 2, 3]
```

## Utility Types

TypeScript's built-in utility types are incredibly powerful:

- `Partial<T>` - Makes all properties optional
- `Required<T>` - Makes all properties required
- `Pick<T, K>` - Picks specific properties
- `Omit<T, K>` - Omits specific properties
- `Record<K, V>` - Creates an object type with keys K and values V

## Discriminated Unions

One of the most powerful patterns for type-safe code:

```typescript
type Result<T> = 
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; error: string }
```

This pattern makes it impossible to access `data` without first checking for success.
